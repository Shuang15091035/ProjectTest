官方文档有对Shader.Find有以下描述：
Note that a shader might be not included into the player build if nothing references it! In that case, Shader.Find will work only in the editor, and will result in pink "missing shader" materials in the player build. Because of that, it is advisable to use shader references instead of finding them by name. To make sure a shader is included into the game build, do either of: 1) reference it from some of the materials used in your scene, 2) add it under "Always Included Shaders" list in ProjectSettings/Graphics or 3) put shader or something that references it (e.g. a Material) into a "Resources" folder.
